# Swish Analytics Front End Developer Project

The goal of this project is for us at Swish Analytics to gain an understanding of your
front end development skills. Specifically, we'd like to see how well you work with React and 3rd party packages, how well you understand JavaScript fundamentals
and your ability to render data in a clean and intuitive way.


## Your Task
A critical element in Swish's product is having the ability to alter projections and
player statuses to override model projections. Thus, we need to be able to build tools that
are easy to use and easy to understand to accomplish this.

Please complete the following tasks for this project.

1. Render all the players and their data/stats from src/api.js in a table.  Loading these players should mimic an API call (asynchronous).

2. Give users the ability to adjust players stats (points, rebounds, assists) and mark them as active/inactive and starter/nonstarter.

3. Allow users to search and filter players.

4. Let users set player projections/statuses to the default values. There are multiple right
ways to do this.

Side Notes:
- Feel free to use any module from the npm registry.
- Please style this to some extent.
- Choose whatever file structure makes sense to you. Just please ensure that
the files and components are well organized.
